            <h1>Hi!</h1>
            <div class= line></div>
            <p>For our student's contacts, it is 107s.(first letter of first name)(last name)@nhascholar.com. For an example, if we have Jessica Anderson, it would be; 107s.janderson. If there is another person with an indentical account name coming after someone else, we would add a 2 to the end of it. Jordan Anderson is an example of this, it would be, 107s.janderson2nhascholar.com.</p>
            <br>
            <p>For our teachers, deans and principal, it is the same scenario. One different is there because we need to be able to tell who is a student and who isn't, we remove the "s" after the "107". This is because the "s" means scholar.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Thanks for reading and we hope this helps you indentify emails for our school.</p>
